Machine readable Information Delivery Specification
---------------------------------------------------

An Information Delivery Specification (IdS) is a computer interpretable document that defines the Exchange Requirements of model based exchange. It defines how objects, classifications, properties, and even values and units need to be delivered and exchanged. This can be a combination of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), Domain Extensions, and additional classifications and properties (national agreements or company specific ones; either stored in bSDD or somewhere else). This is the standard to use to define your Level of Information Needs. It brings validation of IFC to the client, the modeler and the Software Tools that perform (automated) analyses. It is a core component that can be used as a contract to deliver the correct information. It holds the ability to create localized and use-case specific requirements for your projects and asset portfolio. The IDS is the solution for predictable and reliable data exchange workflows.

### Your contract, your validation mechanism, your quality assurance

The project is a collaboration between 60+ people from all over the world. End users, standardization bodies and software vendors are part of the team.
A more extensive overview of the IDS can be found in [this blogpost from february 2023](https://www.buildingsmart.org/what-is-information-delivery-specification-ids/).
